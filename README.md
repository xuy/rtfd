# rtfd
Offline Access to Python documents (readthedoc)

Tired of Googling the same doc over and over again? Need to lookup some documents when working offline? Why not downloading the documents
to your local machine?

rtfd does just that. Just use

python rtfd.py [the-pip-package-name]

that's it. All you needed is to bookmark the index.html page in this folder.
